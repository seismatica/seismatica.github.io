## About me

I am a [former engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanhnguyen-vn/) üè≠, [self-taught coder](https://github.com/seismatica/) üíª, and [lifelong learner](https://medium.com/@seismatica) üìñ.

Currently, as a data scientist, I have a proven track record in all stages of the data science pipeline, including:

* **Data acquisition**: I've scraped thousands of webpages to build an AI-powered search engine.

* **Modeling**: I've built systems that recommend keywords to user's query, or similar products to those users have interacted.

* **Integration**: I've worked closely with data engineers to integrate multiple data science projects to production, from proof-of-concept demonstrations to live systems with periodic updates.

What gets me excited the most about being a data scientist is *helping people*, whether to:

* **Research** on whether a data science tool or technique will be effective to solve a business problem, and how feasible are they to be implemented by the data science team.

* **Propose** relevant metrics to benchmark the data science models being implemented, as well as implementing improvements to these models against the chosen metrics.

* **Communicate** the results of data science projects at all levels (from team leaders, to directors, to other technical staff) to get buy-off for model deployment in production, to help them make better business decisions, or simply to learn more about the wonderful world of data science.

Aside from my use of data science at work, I am passionate communicating all aspects of data science to the community at large. Examples include:

* How to use data science for personal interests, such as [weight loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-my-weight-loss-journey-with-machine-learning-b74aa2e170f2?source=friends_link&sk=132ba842d95afc92d4e3a0dc6accc7e5) or [predicting sports results](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-figure-skating-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-fc704fa7971a?source=friends_link&sk=7e6b2992c6dd5e6e7e1803c574b4236d)
* Understand the mathematics behind fundamental data science concepts, such as [Gaussian sampling](https://medium.com/mti-technology/how-to-generate-gaussian-samples-347c391b7959?source=friends_link&sk=46282403d3478247812038bfa0d1febf) and [language models](https://medium.com/mti-technology/n-gram-language-model-b7c2fc322799?source=friends_link&sk=d03df89a05762efb92a411874e84fea9).
