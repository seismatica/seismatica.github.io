## About me

I'm a [former engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dknguyen-vn/) üè≠, [self-taught coder](https://medium.com/@seismatica/mit-6-00-1x-review-ef4f3561e114?source=friends_link&sk=dba9a641f7589b0723964fa5d4289186) üíª, and [lifelong learner](https://medium.com/@seismatica) üìñ.

Currently, as a data scientist, I have a proven track record in all stages of the data science pipeline, including:

* **Data acquisition**: I've scraped thousands of webpages to build NLP models for an AI-powered search engine.

* **Modeling**: I've built systems that recommend keywords to user's query, or similar products to those users have interacted.

* **Integration**: I've worked closely with data engineers to integrate multiple data science models to production, from proof-of-concept demonstrations to real-time systems with regular model updates.

What gets me excited the most about being a data scientist is *helping people*, whether to:

* **Research** on whether a data science tool or technique will be effective to solve a business problem, and how feasible they are to be implemented by the data science team.

* **Propose** relevant metrics to benchmark the data science models being implemented, as well as applying improvements to these models against the chosen metrics.

* **Communicate** the results and benefits of a data science project to stakeholders at all levels‚Äîfrom team leaders, to directors, to other technical staff.

Aside from work, I am passionate about sharing interesting aspects of data science, such as:

* How to use data science for **personal interests**, such as [weight loss](https://towardsdatascience.com/analyzing-my-weight-loss-journey-with-machine-learning-b74aa2e170f2?source=friends_link&sk=132ba842d95afc92d4e3a0dc6accc7e5) or [predicting sports results](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-figure-skating-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-fc704fa7971a?source=friends_link&sk=7e6b2992c6dd5e6e7e1803c574b4236d)
* How to implement the **mathematics** behind fundamental data science concepts, such as [Gaussian sampling](https://medium.com/mti-technology/how-to-generate-gaussian-samples-347c391b7959?source=friends_link&sk=46282403d3478247812038bfa0d1febf) or [language models](https://medium.com/mti-technology/n-gram-language-model-b7c2fc322799?source=friends_link&sk=d03df89a05762efb92a411874e84fea9).
